<h1 align='center'> (Early) Data / Statistical Analysis </h1>

<hr>

Here is a collection of data / statistical analysis work conducted at the start of my data science career. Much of the coding was conducted in the early stages of my Python learning.

The above notebooks include an analysis of London Underground travelling patterns, an analysis to determine bridge structural integrity and a property pricing analysis. The final notebook analyses the number of storks (bird) in a given land area to determine if there is any statistical evidence that storks may actually deliver babies.
